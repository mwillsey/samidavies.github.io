* Next year, I'll serve as the secretary for UW's chapter of [AWM](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~awmsc/). We host events to help create a supportive and inclusive environment for women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics (WUMiM).

* I teach incarcerated women math through [FEPPS](http://fepps.org). I'm always interested in having discussions about prison reform.

* I started volunteering at UW's [Math Circles](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~mathcircle/circle/) during the Spring of 2018.

* [Sam Fairchild](http://sites.math.washington.edu/~skayf/index.html), [Kellie MacPhee](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~kmacphee/), and I are co-founding the Washington [Directed Reading Program](https://www.drp-network.org). The program will begin during the Fall 2018 quarter.
