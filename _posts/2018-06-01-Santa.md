Given a set of presents and a set of children who each desire some subset of presents: how should Santa distribute presents among the kids in order to maximize the minimum happiness of any child? Our goal is to design an approximation algorithm which not only gives a better constant factor approximation than the best known, but which also compares to an LP smaller than those in all previous work.
Ongoing work with Thomas Rothvoss and Yihao Zhang.
