Ok, not really news. But I've recently added a link to my GitHub account, so you can see some of the coding projects I've been working on in the past few months. I started refamiliarizing myself with Python after a several year hiatus by doing a bunch of easy [Project Euler puzzles](https://projecteuler.net). More recently, I've been doing projects in SML, Racket, and Ruby to better understand different type systems (though you'll need to ask for permission to see these files).
