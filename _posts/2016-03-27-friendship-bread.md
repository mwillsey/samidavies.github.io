### There are two types of people

$$>99$$% of people hear *friendship bread* and think "Oh, that sounds weird." The remaining $$<1$$% have lived in central Pennsylvania for part of their life and think "Oh my god yes where is it give it here." Friendship bread is an absolutely delicious cinnamon and sugar bread. It's sweet and moist like banana bread, with  the same cake-like consistency.

Why the name? It's a [sourdough bread](http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/blueroom/sour.htm). This means the bread begins from a "starter", which is a combination of water, yeast, sugar, and sometimes milk. In the starter, the yeast grows, so you never have to add more. Instead you just keep feeding it by adding more ingredients. Also, you normally give away some of the starter to your *friends* after you've finished it. Hence friendship.

Friendship bread is more properly called Amish friendship bread. The Amish are supposedly the only people who know the real recipe for the starter. I grew up eating friendship bread made from starter one of my mom's Amish acquaintance had given her. However... the friendship bread starter recipe on allrecipes.com produces bread that tastes exactly the same. So, I'm pretty sure the starter recipe isn't actually a secret.

### Starter recipe

This [starter recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/7063/amish-friendship-bread-starter/) is completely from allrecipes.com, but I've also included some tips at the bottom of this post. The first couple will be helpful if you're new to making starter.

----

#### You'll need

-- 1 (.25 oz) package or 2 1/4 teaspoons of active dry yeast

-- 1/4 cup warm water (110$$^{\circ}$$ fahrenheit, 45$$^{\circ}$$ celsius)

-- 3 cups flour, divided

-- 3 cups granulated sugar, divided

-- 3 cups milk, divided

----

#### To do


**Day 1**

In a small nonmetal bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Let it stand for ~10 minutes. If your yeast isn't foamy, something's wrong, see the tips below.

In a larger nonmetal container (I recommend a glass jar, large ziploc, or tupperware ), combine 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of sugar. Stir it thoroughly, or better yet sift it, to avoid lumpy batter later.

Slowly stir 1 cup of milk and the dissolved yeast mixture into the flour and sugar. Close your container or keep it loosely covered. If whatever container you chose closes completely, gas will collect in the container and need to be released everyday.

**Days 2, 3, 4**

Stir starter.

**Day 5**

Stir in 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of sugar, and a cup of milk.

**Days 6, 7, 8, 9**

Stir starter.

**Day 10**

Stir in 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of sugar, and a cup of milk.

Your starter is complete. There's a lot of it; this recipe makes 4 cups/ servings. At this point:

-- To establish the full irony of the bread's namesake, give a friend or two a cup of starter so they can grow it themselves, or make their own bread right away.

-- Freeze your starter if you don't want to do anything with it yet.

-- Make some bread with the recipe below.

 It's typical to give 2 servings away, keep one in the freezer until you wish to start the process again, and bake the last serving for yourself.

### Bread recipe

After all that work the starter took, the bread is very easy to make. You can use a stand mixer if you'd like, but really just dumping everything in a bowl and mixing is fine.

The recipe below is based off [this one](http://www.friendshipbreadkitchen.com/recipe-amish-friendship-bread/), but there's a few variations.

---

#### You'll need

-- 1 cup of Amish friendship bread starter

-- 1 cup of oil

-- 1/2 cup of milk

-- 1 teaspoon of vanilla

-- 3 eggs

-- 1 cup of sugar

-- 2 cups of flour

-- 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder

-- 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda

-- 1/2 teaspoon of salt

-- 2 teaspoons of cinnamon

-- 3 small boxes of instant pudding mix (any flavor to make interesting bread, for original use French vanilla)

-- cinnamon sugar mixture: >1/2 cup sugar and >1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon

-- optional mix-ins: 2 cups of chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit, whatever else you'd like

---

#### To do

Preheat oven to 350$$^{\circ}$$ F, 165$$^{\circ}$$ C. Grease 2 loaf pans, coat with most of the cinnamon sugar mixture.

If your starter is lumpy or if your batter gets lumpy in this process, see my tips below. In a large bowl, combine the wet ingredients: starter, oil, milk, vanilla, eggs, sugar. Stir until batter is smooth.

In another bowl, combine the dry ingredients except the pudding mix: flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon.  Stir until just combined.

Pour the dry ingredients into the wet mixture. Stir until mostly combined. Add the instant vanilla pudding and stir until just combined. Add any additional mix-ins.

Bake for about 1 hour total. After the bread has been baking for about 30-40 minutes, pull it out of the oven and pour the rest of the cinnamon sugar mixture on top. The bread is done when you can pull it away from the edges of the pan and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

### Tips

Adding water that's too hot to yeast will kill it, and adding water that's too cold won't enable the yeast to multiply. The water should not feel hot, but also not cool to touch. Water stops feeling cool to the touch above 100$$^{\circ}$$ fahrenheit. If your yeast water mix isn't foamy, the water temperature might be off. But no big deal just try again.

Use nonmetal containers, bowls, and mixing utensils that could come into contact with the yeast. So a metal sifter for flour is fine but a metal container for your starter might not be. Some metals will react poorly with the yeast and ruin your starter.

If you've got lumpy starter at the beginning, the lumps will go away as the starter grows. I recommend you sift the flour and sugar as you continue the starter. If your ending starter still is lumpy, pour it into a large container, or break it up into small batches, so you can break up the clumps with a plastic spatula. Be careful not to overmix your starter when doing this.

To eat like a true central PA'ian. Serve with two healthy slabs of butter on top and maybe some more cinnamon sugar. Delicious fresh out of the oven, but I actually prefer it a day or 2 old. The top crust gets deliciously soft and the flavors in the bread just get to know each other a bit better.
