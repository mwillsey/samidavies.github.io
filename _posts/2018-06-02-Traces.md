In the trace reconstruction problem, an unknown binary string is put through a deletion channel, which deletes each bit with some constant probability, and noisy traces are output. This arises in DNA storage and sensor networks. The question catching the attention of many people: how many noisy traces are needed to reconstruct the original string with high probability? Currently, both the average case and worst case instances of this problem are dead stuck- the best methods have been pushed as far as they can go and no one has presented any other promising ways forward.

We are studying variants of this question on structures other than strings. This has several interesting applications in its own right, but might also give insight to a new method that can make progress in the string case.
