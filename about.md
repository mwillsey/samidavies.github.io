This site is managed by me (Sami Davies)! I'm currently a first year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science](http://www.math.uic.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. After completing this year at UIC, I'll be relocating to the University of Washington to continue working towards my PhD. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a BS in Mathematical Sciences in May 2015. The goal of this blog is to

* Introduce areas in my field of study, which particular pique my interest.
* Improve my ability to answer "So you're a math PhD student... what do you do?"
* Selfishly relieve my own stress when I have my weekly quarter life crisis about "Wow I just spent 14 hours thinking about triangles. Why am I doing this with my life."

An event is said to happen **with high probability** if the probability of the event happening depends on some number $$n$$, and as $$n$$ tends towards $$\infty$$, the probability of the event occurring tends towards 1. In a world where so much is uncertain, *with high probability* embraces the trustworthiness of mathematical settings.

TBA I can do things and I have done things, but too busy rn to tell you about them.
