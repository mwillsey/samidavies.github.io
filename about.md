This site is managed by me (Sami Davies)! I am currently a first year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science](http://www.math.uic.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, aka UIC. After completing this year at UIC, I'll be relocating -- I'm 1/2 of a [2 body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem_\(career\)) -- to a TBD PhD program in  either math or CS. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a BS in Mathematical Sciences in May 2015. The goal of this blog is to

1. Introduce areas in my field of study, which particular pique my interest.
2. Improve my ability to answer "So you're a math PhD student... what do you do?"
3. Selfishly relieve my own stress when I have my weekly quarter life crisis about "Wow I just spent 14 hours thinking about triangles. Why am I doing this with my life."

An event is said to happen **with high probability** if the probability of the event happening depends on some number $$n$$, and as $$n$$ tends towards $$\infty$$, the probability of the event occurring tends towards 1.  *With high probability* embraces the beauty of randomness in a chaotic world where very little in our daily lives actually occurs with high probability.
